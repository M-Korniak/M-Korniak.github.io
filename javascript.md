**JavaScript** (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the 
World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side 
for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have 
a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
